# The barefoot wealth accumulation strategy

The barefoot wealth accumulation strategy follows the principles detailed in the "The Barefoot Investor" book authored by Scott Pape. His investment strategy uses three overflowing buckets: Blow, Mojo and Grow. Six bank accounts are set up and organised into these buckets, serving various purposes. Once each purpose is fulfilled, it overflows into the following bucket, naturally accumulating wealth over one's lifetime.

## Buckets

1. Blow
   - 60% - Daily expenses
   - 20% - Fire extinguisher - pays down debt (overflows)
   - 10% - Splurge
   - 10% - Smile
2. Mojo
   - Emergency fund - with a $2000 minimum, it fills to 3-6 months of income (overflows)
3. Grow
   - Investments (builds exponentially)
     - Superannuation
     - Home Deposit
     - EFT investing
     - Speculation

## Accumulation process

- Income enters the Blow bucket.
- The Blow bucket divides this income into four accounts.
- You live on 60% of your income to satisfy essential living expenses.
- While 20% is spent on enjoying life in a financially responsible manner.
- Next, by using the remaining 20%, you extinguish all financial fires by paying down existing debt.
- After all financial fires have been extinguished, the money overflows into the Mojo bucket.
- The overflowed money fills the "Emergency fund" to 3-6 months of income, acting as a debt card when needed.
- The "Emergency fund" overflows into the Grow bucket once it is filled.
- The Grow bucket holds all your investments, which grow via compound interest and dollar-cost averaging.
- The investments in the Grow buckets are structured to ensure a financially secure retirement is achieved.
